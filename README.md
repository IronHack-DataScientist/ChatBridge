## About the Project

In a globally connected world, language differences should no longer pose a barrier to effective communication. **ChatBridge** addresses this challenge by offering a real-time translation service via WhatsApp. Whether you're a business owner dealing with international clients or an individual connecting with friends abroad, ChatBridge ensures your messages are understood, regardless of the language.

ChatBridge integrates with Twilio and uses AI-powered translation models to translate messages as they are sent and received, maintaining the context and tone of the conversation.

## Features

- **Real-Time Translation:** Messages are translated instantly, providing smooth, uninterrupted conversations across languages.
- **Automatic Language Detection:** Detects the language of incoming messages without manual input.
- **Bidirectional Support:** Translates both incoming and outgoing messages for seamless dialogue.
- **Dynamic Target Management:** Easily assign target numbers for your translations via simple WhatsApp commands.
- **Advanced AI Models:** Uses Hugging Face and Gemini models to ensure high-quality translations.

## Project Architecture

ChatBridge is built on a robust architecture that ensures reliable and accurate message translation:

1. **Twilio Integration**: Handles the receipt and sending of WhatsApp messages.
2. **Language Detection API**: Automatically identifies the language of incoming messages.
3. **Translation Models**: Utilizes AI models (Hugging Face and Gemini) for translating messages.
4. **Backend Framework**: Implemented using Python and Flask for efficient request handling and processing.
5. **CSV Handler**: Manages language preferences and ISO codes for different WhatsApp numbers.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- Twilio API credentials
- Hugging Face and Gemini API access

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IronHack-DataScientist/ChatBridge.git
    cd ChatBridge
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your Twilio and API credentials, along with any other necessary environment variables.

### Running the Application

Start the Flask server:

```bash
flask run
```

The application will start, and you can begin sending messages to your Twilio number to see translations in action.

## Usage

### How to Use ChatBridge

1. **Start a Conversation**: Send a message to the Twilio number associated with ChatBridge. The message will be translated into the recipient's language and forwarded.
2. **Assign a Target Number**: Use the format `to:<target_number>` to direct your translated messages to a specific WhatsApp number.
3. **End a Session**: Use the command `exit` to clear the current target and end the session.

### Examples

- **Customer (English):** "Hello, I would like to know more about your services."
- **ChatBridge (Translation to Spanish):** "Hola, me gustarÃ­a saber mÃ¡s sobre sus servicios."
- **Business Owner (Spanish):** "Claro, Â¿cÃ³mo puedo ayudarte?"
- **ChatBridge (Translation to English):** "Sure, how can I help you?"

## Performance Analysis

### Translation Model Comparison

ChatBridge employs both Hugging Face and Gemini translation models. We've conducted detailed performance analysis to compare these models in terms of speed and accuracy.

- **[Implementation of Hugging Face Models](https://github.com/IronHack-DataScientist/ChatBridge/blob/main/modules/translation/hf_translation.py)**
- **[Testing of Hugging Face Models](https://github.com/IronHack-DataScientist/ChatBridge/blob/main/modules/translation/hf_translation.py)**
- **[Translation Model Comparison](https://ironhack-datascientist.github.io/ChatBridge/#comparison-by-model):** A comprehensive comparison of how quickly each model translates different text types across various languages.
- **[Evaluation of Model Performance](https://github.com/IronHack-DataScientist/ChatBridge/blob/main/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Translation%20Performance%20Evaluation.ipynb)**

### BLEU Score Analysis

The BLEU score is a key metric used to evaluate the quality of translations. Our analysis includes:

- **[Visualizing Model Performance](https://github.com/IronHack-DataScientist/ChatBridge/blob/main/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Translation%20Performance%20Visualization.ipynb)**
- **BLEU Score Distribution**: Histograms and box plots that show the BLEU score distribution across different text types and languages.
- **Correlation Analysis**: A scatter plot examining the correlation between translation times and BLEU scores, offering insights into the trade-offs between speed and quality.
