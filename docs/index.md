## Comparison of Translation Times by Model

This bar chart compares the translation times between two different translation models, "HF" and "Gemini." The data is melted to align both models on a single axis, showing the translation time (in seconds) for each model. The bars are grouped by model, allowing for a clear comparison of performance in terms of speed.

- **HF Model**: Represents the translation times taken by the HF translation system.
- **Gemini Model**: Represents the translation times taken by the Gemini translation system.

This visualization helps to quickly assess which model performs translations faster under the given conditions.
